# CalmPulse

**CalmPulse** is an intelligent, real-time emotional and physical state monitoring app designed to support autistic individuals and their caregivers. It combines sensor data from a mobile device, voice analysis, and AI-based or heuristic motion classification to track and infer behavioral and emotional states â€” helping caregivers respond proactively to stress, panic, or discomfort.

##  Features

###  Frontend

* **Interactive caregiver dashboard** for real-time activity and emotional summaries.
* **Child-friendly interface** with customizable animal avatars.
  
###  Backend

* WebSocket integration with **SensorServer** to capture:

  * Real-time **accelerometer** and **gyroscope** data.
  * Heart rate (via Google Fit or Health Connect â€“ planned).
* Data buffers and threaded processing for:

  * **Rule-based motion classification** (`Running`, `Walking`, `Standing`, `Sleeping`).
  * **Minute-wise behavior logs** in JSON.

###  Transcript & Sentiment Analysis

* Processes audio to:

  * Transcribe speech.
  * Extract **term frequency** and **voice frequency**.
  * Perform **sentiment analysis** (using Hugging Face or other pretrained models).
* Detect emotional states: `Calm`, `Happy`, `Anxious`, `Distressed`.
